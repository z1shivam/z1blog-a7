# My blog project.

With this proeject, I am making my end to end blog by myself. Everything GUI. I can write, manage and analyse everything on my own from the ui of the app.

I have already built a lot of things now. From authentication to writing form.
My today's task is to make the dashboard and analytics page.

## Feature to build today:

- [x] Impliment load more functionality in the image store.
- [x] Impliment logout from everywhere functionality.
- [ ] dashboard page to show basic things like total reads, total likes, total blogs, and a create blog form button.
- [ ] then a table which will show the information about each blog i write and da button to edit/ publish or delete it.
- [ ] asset management page where I can view, edit, delete any image i have uploaded on cloudinary.
